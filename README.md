# homozygosity_calculator
A script that I wrote to calculate the percentage of homozygous SNPs from a 23andme raw data file

#Description: reads in a tab delinated file of 23andme data and outputs the percent homozygous sites. 
#Usage: perl homozygosity_percent.pl snps.txt

Not tested extensively, but should be fully functional and accurate.
